# small scrip to compute the solution of Lippmann-Schwinger equation
# We test the types introduced in FastConvolution.jl
# we test that the application is fast and that the construction
# is performed fast.
# This script is to test that solving the method is robust to 
# solving the Lippmann Schwinger equation in rectangular domains
# instead of just squared domains
